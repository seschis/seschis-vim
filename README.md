keeping track of my vim setup and plugins

# Some helper stuff that I'll likely forget
This vim dir is using native vim-8 packages. They are simple git-clones of vim
plugins and placed into \<.vim\>/pack/plugins/\<name\>

Ex.
    git submodule add https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive.git pack/plugins/start/vim-fugitive
